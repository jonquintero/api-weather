## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.


## API function

Given a location (a city for example) the service connects to a third party API which returns information regarding the weather.

This information is processed for the purpose of determining:
- If the location name the number of characters is odd.
- The calculation is made to know in degrees celcius the temperature of the consulted city.
- Compare temperature between two cities.

Returns Boolean values ​​with respect to the previous cases.

Note: a service like this if it were to go into production, it would be ideal to obtain the name of a city, a third-party service such as google

## Test API

- Run composer install command
- Run php artisan key:generate
- To run test use this command: php artisan test
- To use API from postman use the file apiweather.postman_collection.json
